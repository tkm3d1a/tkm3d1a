# About **Me**

### Baseball Reference Web application
Link: [DB-found-webApp](https://github.com/tkm3d1a/DB-found-webApp)

This was a final group project based around replicating the [baseball-reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) website, at least somewhat.  It is a fully local hosted web application with a MariaDB database behind it, built using Python/Flask.  The readme has all the info required to download and install and set up the release branch, and I do plan on updating it to clean up the code.

*My favorite features*
- I did my own hashing and salting of passwords so that they are only stored encrypted, and the plain text version is not exposed
  - It isn't an ideal method and probably doesn't follow best practices, but it works and is pretty dead simple to understand
- No JS or outside languages were used/needed to complete tasks such as filtering/saving of favorite players
- Use and manipulation of DB through ORM

# Project Pipeline üî≠

I unfortunatley don't have anything really planned right now.  Between grad school and work I just don't have the time I wish I did for projects.  I am continually working to learn and improve more though, and will update here as I complete either interesting course work, tutorial/projects, or if I get some time to knock out anything else!
