# My Favorite Repos 🏆

### Baseball Reference Web application
Link: [DB-found-webApp](https://github.com/tkm3d1a/DB-found-webApp)

This was a final group project based around replicating the [baseball-reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) website, at least somewhat.  It is a fully local hosted web application with a MariaDB database behind it, built using Python/Flask.  The readme has all the info required to download and install and set up the release branch, and I do plan on updating it to clean up the code.

*My favorite features*
- I did my own hashing and salting of passwords so that they are only stored encrypted, and the plain text version is not exposed
  - It isn't an ideal method and probably doesn't follow best practices, but it works and is pretty dead simple to understand
- No JS or outside languages were used/needed to complete tasks such as filtering/saving of favorite players
- Use and manipulation of DB through ORM

# Project Pipeline 🔭

Outside of learning with some Udemy courses, I am currently working on improving the Baseball Reference application.  I plan on converting it to a react based application, keeping the MaraiDB backend, and utilizing python and flask for the api service.  This will be my "side" project so may not get as many updates, but it will be more detailed and have more involved planing using tools like Figma and Trello.
