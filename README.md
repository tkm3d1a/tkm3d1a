# About **Me**
My Name is Tim.  I am currently a Project Engineer in the transportation industry.  I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and am currently pursuing a masters in Computer Science.  I also like to mess with the idea of game programming, but really havent been able to branch into anything fun quite yet.


# Project showcase 🏆

Nothing wothwhile *quite yet*...

😭😭😭

# Project Pipeline 🔭

Below are my current project plans...

1. A smart product numbering system
    - This would allow a user to smartly number and track across a variety of project and product types
    - The idea is meant for more physical projects but can be adapted to be used with anything requiring version control systems
    - The intent is to write this mostly in C# and WPF
2. A Pathifinding algorithim visualizer
    - This is a newer idea, not fully fleshed out yet
    - The plan is to show at least 3 major algorithm types
      - Dijkstra's
      - A* Pathfinidng
      - D* Pathfinding (maybe? need to see if worth visualixing over A*)
    - Not sure on which langugage or how to start with the visualization yet though
3. A Discord Bot for personal use
    - The idea is to have fun with friends in our personal discord
    - Will be written using JS discord bot API's
    - Main features will be:
      - Cat "facts"
      - Dad Joke API calls
      - About funciton
      - Help function
